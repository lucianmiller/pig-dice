    <h1>Pig Dice</h1>
    <p>Pig Dice is a folk dice game. Players take turns rolling a dice as many times as they wish. Players add up their points they roll. Rolling a 1 looses all the points you've rolled for that turn, and it becomes the second players turn. First to reach 100 is the winner! In this version of Pig Dice, you will be playing against a computer. Make the first roll.</p>
